### 001_Count-Integual-num
描述: 统计字符串中整数的个数，如abc123egf，其中整数为1个

### 002_LetterChanges
描述:
Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the 
alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in 
this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.

### 003_Sum-of-Numbers
描述：
Given two integers, which can be positive and negative, find the sum of 
all the numbers between including them too and return it. 
If both numbers are equal return a or b.

### 004_Title-Case
描述：
A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string 
is either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word 
is in upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely 
into lower case unless it is the first word, which is always capitalised.

Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an 
optional list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will 
be given as a string with each word separated by a space. 
Your function should ignore the case of the minor words string -- it 
should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string 
is changed.

### 005_Two-Sum
描述：
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
The return format had been changed to zero-based indices.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
